# Shelfmark

Your own shelf, added by hand — a private, offline-first personal library
for PDFs, notes (Markdown), pictures, and audio recordings. Fully
client-side: no backend, no account, no analytics. Everything is encrypted
and stored only in your browser's IndexedDB, on your own device.

## Features in this build

- **Full-screen lock screen.** On first run you set a passcode (no
  recovery — there's nothing to reset server-side, so write it down). On
  every later visit you must enter it before the shelf is shown.
- **IndexedDB encryption.** AES-256-GCM, with a key derived from your
  passcode via PBKDF2 (250,000 iterations, random per-device salt). The key
  lives only in memory for the current session — it's never written to
  disk. Item metadata (titles, categories, bookmarks, reading progress) and
  file content (PDFs/images/audio bytes, note text) are encrypted
  separately, so opening the shelf list doesn't require decrypting every
  file, only the small metadata blobs.
- **PWA / offline support.** Installable (Add to Home Screen / desktop
  install prompt), with a service worker that caches the app shell so it
  keeps working with no network connection after the first load.
- **App icon.** A dedicated icon set (192/512/maskable/apple-touch), built
  from the same PDF/Markdown/Image/Audio colors used inside the app — this
  is separate from (and replaces) the small browser-tab favicon used
  before.
- **Version badge.** Bottom-right corner, visible even on the lock screen
  before you type a passcode. See "Versioning" below.

## Files

```
index.html          — shell, lock screen markup, CSS
app.js               — all app logic, crypto, and the version badge label
service-worker.js    — offline cache (has its own version constant)
manifest.json        — Web App Manifest
icons/               — favicon.svg, icon-192.png, icon-512.png,
                        icon-maskable-512.png, apple-touch-icon.png
```

## Deploying (GitHub Pages)

1. Push this whole folder's contents to your repo (root, or a `/docs`
   folder — either works, just set GitHub Pages to serve that location).
2. Settings → Pages → deploy from the branch/folder you pushed to.
3. Open the published URL once online so the service worker installs and
   precaches the app shell — after that it works offline.

### Deploy checklist — **do this on every change, not just feature ones**

- [ ] Bump `APP_VERSION` **and** `APP_VERSION_DATE` at the top of `app.js`.
- [ ] Bump `CACHE_VERSION` at the top of `service-worker.js` to match.
      (These two are independent constants in independent files — nothing
      keeps them in sync automatically. Each file has a comment pointing at
      the other as a reminder.)
- [ ] If you added/renamed/removed any static file, update `PRECACHE_URLS`
      in `service-worker.js` to match.
- [ ] Commit and push both files together, never just one.

**Why this matters:** the version badge only tells you what code shipped in
*this build* — not what the browser is actually running right now. If you
ever see a version number after deploying that doesn't match what you
expect, that's the signal to hard-refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) or clear the
site's Service Worker + Cache Storage in DevTools — not a sign the deploy
itself failed. A stale service worker serving an old cached shell is the
most common reason the two look out of sync.

## Security notes

- No network calls carry your data anywhere. The only external requests
  this build makes are none at all — Google Fonts was removed in this
  version specifically so the app has zero external dependencies and works
  fully offline; UI text now uses system fonts instead of Lora/Inter.
- Forgetting your passcode has no recovery path by design (there's no
  server holding a spare key). The lock screen's "Forgot passcode" option
  wipes the local IndexedDB database entirely so you can start over —
  it does not recover old data.
- Use Export (⇡ in the header) periodically if you want a backup outside
  the browser. Choose "Encrypted" (the default) and it's protected with its
  own passphrase, separate from your app-lock passcode — pick something you
  can remember independently, since it's the only way back into that file.
  "Plain JSON" is available but fully readable by anyone who opens it; only
  use it somewhere you already trust.

## Changelog

- **v1.1.0** (2026-09-25) — Export is no longer plain JSON by default. The
  export button now opens a modal offering "Encrypted" (default) or "Plain
  JSON" (opt-in, with an inline warning). Encrypted backups use their own
  passphrase — independent of your app-lock passcode, chosen at export time
  — via AES-256-GCM with a PBKDF2-derived key (250,000 iterations, random
  salt, stored alongside the ciphertext in the file). Import auto-detects
  an encrypted backup (`encrypted:true` in the file) and prompts for its
  passphrase before merging; plain/legacy export files import unchanged.
- **v1.0.0** (2026-09-25) — Packaged from the single-file prototype into a
  multi-file PWA: added the full-screen passcode lock screen, AES-256-GCM +
  PBKDF2 IndexedDB encryption (metadata and file content encrypted
  separately), offline service worker with app-shell caching, Web App
  Manifest, a dedicated icon set replacing the old favicon, and the
  bottom-right version badge visible pre-unlock. Removed the Google Fonts
  dependency so the app has no external network dependency at all.
